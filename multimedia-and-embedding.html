  <h2>Images in HTML</h2>
  <p>Place &lt;img&gt; tags within a &lt;figure&gt; tag to structure content. After inputting your image in the &lt;figure&gt; tag, you can add a &lt;figcaption&gt; tag to provide a caption for your image.</p>
  <p><strong>Example code:</strong></p>
  <code><pre>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Caption goes here
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
</pre></code>
  <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
    <figure>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/dinosaur_small.jpg" alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth" width="400" height="341" />
      <figcaption>
        A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p>A figure doesn't have to be an image. It is an independent unit of content that:
    <ul>
    <li>Expresses your meaning in a compact, easy-to-grasp way.</li>
    <li>Could go in several places in the page's linear flow.</li>
    <li>Provides essential information supporting the main text.</li>
    </ul>
    A figure could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or something else.</p>
        <h2>CSS Background Images</h2>
        <p>You can use CSS to place images directly on your page's background. You can more easily control the placement of CSS background images relative to HTML images using CSS background- properties. That said, CSS background images are decorative only; unlike HTML images, they cannot be interacted with or make use of accessibility features.</p>
        <ul><li>MDN suggests only using CSS background images when your images are for purely decorative purposes</li>
            <ul><li>In other words, probably not the greatest idea for a photography portfolio. But I should look into this more before ruling it out</li></ul></ul>
            </div>
        <p><strong>Example code:</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <code><pre>
p {
  background-image: url("images/dinosaur.jpg");
}
    </pre></code>

    <h2>Embedding content</h2>
    <p><strong>Disregard the content below this paragraph; need to make new pages for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Other_embedding_technologies">object to iframe</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web">vectors</a>; and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">responsive images</a>.<br>My corresponding pages are located <a href="object-iframe.html">here</a> (objects and iframes), <a href="vectors.html">here</a> (vectors), and <a href="responsive-images.html">here</a> (responsive images).</strong><br>-----------------------------------</p>
    <p>There are three ways to embed content: &lt;iframe&gt;, &lt;embed&gt;, and &lt;object&gt;. iFrames are most common. <strong>See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Other_embedding_technologies" target="_blank">here for more information</a> on when to use embedding techniques and how to mitigate potential security concerns</strong>.</li>
  <h2>Using vectors</h2>
  <p><strong>For more information on how to insert vectors, see this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web">page</a> for more info</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When inserting a SVG into your HTML, the method you use to add the SVG--e.g., &lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt; vs &lt;svg&gt;--carry different advantages.</li>
    <ul><li>The latter method is the only one which allows you to manipulate the vector using CSS attributes. However, it's best to only use the &lt;svg&gt; method when the vector only appears on one page of your website as this method increases the size of the overall SVG file.</li></ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Method one (&lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt;):<br>
        <code><pre>&lt;img src="/images/clairecarmi-logo-2.svg" id="logo"&gt;</pre></code>

        <!-- To center SVG, input the following in the element: add style="display: block; margin:auto;" -->
    <li>This isn't listed on MDN's guide about SVGs, but to resize a vector, there are two options:
      <ul><li>For vectors inserted using &lt;image src=&quot;&quot;&gt;, apply a matching ID to the vector in the &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt; elements. After making sure the width and height attributes within the SVG file are set to 100%, change the width and height within the &lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt; element (e.g., height=&quot;100&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;). See this <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-svg-images-in-css-html/">guide here</a> for more information.</li>
      <li>For vectors inserted using &lt;svg&gt; elements, add height and width attributes to the SVG file's code and set them to your desired value in pixels (e.g., height=&quot;250px&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;). Save the SVG's source code in your images folder and paste it into the HTML file where you want the vector to appear. See <a href="https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/63726/resizing-svg-files">this guide</a> for more information (note: tested using TextEdit; confirmed to work correctly).</p>
      </li>

    <h2>Responsive images</h2>
    <p><strong>See this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">page</a> for more information on responsive images</strong>.</p>
    <p>There are various problems when it comes to the responsiveness of images (and vectors):
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Art direction problem</strong>: The problem whereby you want to serve cropped images for different layouts—for example a landscape image showing a full scene for a desktop layout, and a portrait image showing the main subject zoomed in for a mobile layout. You can solve this problem using the &lt;picture&gt; element.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Resolution switching problem</strong>: The problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow-screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do — and to serve different resolution images to high density/low density screens. You can solve this problem using vector graphics (SVG images) and the srcset with sizes attributes.

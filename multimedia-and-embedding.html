  <h2>Images in HTML</h2>
  <p>Place &lt;img&gt; tags within a &lt;figure&gt; tag to structure content. After inputting your image in the &lt;figure&gt; tag, you can add a &lt;figcaption&gt; tag to provide a caption for your image.</p>
  <p><strong>Example code:</strong></p>
  <code><pre>
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Caption goes here
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
</pre></code>
  <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
    <figure>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/dinosaur_small.jpg" alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth" width="400" height="341" />
      <figcaption>
        A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p>A figure doesn't have to be an image. It is an independent unit of content that:
    <ul>
    <li>Expresses your meaning in a compact, easy-to-grasp way.</li>
    <li>Could go in several places in the page's linear flow.</li>
    <li>Provides essential information supporting the main text.</li>
    </ul>
    A figure could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or something else.</p>
        <h2>CSS Background Images</h2>
        <p>You can use CSS to place images directly on your page's background. You can more easily control the placement of CSS background images relative to HTML images using CSS background- properties. That said, CSS background images are decorative only; unlike HTML images, they cannot be interacted with or make use of accessibility features.</p>
        <ul><li>MDN suggests only using CSS background images when your images are for purely decorative purposes</li>
            <ul><li>In other words, probably not the greatest idea for a photography portfolio. But I should look into this more before ruling it out</li></ul></ul>
            </div>
        <p><strong>Example code:</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <code><pre>
p {
  background-image: url("images/dinosaur.jpg");
}
    </pre></code>

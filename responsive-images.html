    <h2>Why responsive images?</h2>
    <p>Responsive image technologies combat the issues posed by devices have different screen sizes and resolutions by letting you provide the browser with several image files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels (<em>resolution switching</em>), or different images suitable for different space allocations (<em>art direction</em>).</p>
    <h2>How do you create responsive images?</h2>
    <p>The content discussed in this section focuses on content using the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img">&lt;img&gt;</a></kbd> element. Furthermore, keep in mind that <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-part-8-css-images/">CSS arguably has better tools for responsive design</a> than does HTML.</p>
    <h3>Resolution switching: Different sizes</h3>
    <p>To recap, <strong>resolution switching</strong> allows us to display identical image content that's larger or smaller depending on the device.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, the standard <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img">&lt;img&gt;</a></kbd> element only lets you point the browser to a single source file, as seen below:</p>
<code><pre><strong>HTML</strong>
&lt;img src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg" alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" /&gt;</pre></code>
    <p>We can, however, use two attributes--<kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset">srcset</a></kbd> and <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#sizes">sizes</a></kbd>--to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one. You can see an example of this in our <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/responsive.html">responsive.html</a> example on GitHub (source code <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/responsive.html">here</a>):</p>
<code><pre><strong>HTML</strong>
&lt;img
srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
  800px"
src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" /&gt;</pre></code>
    <p>The <kbd>srcset</kbd> and <kbd>sizes</kbd> attributes both contain a comma-separated list, and each part of these lists is made up of three sub-parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><kbd><strong>srcset</strong></kbd> defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma. For each one, we write:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>An <strong>image filename</strong> (<kbd>elva-fairy-480w.jpg</kbd>).</li>
        <li>A space.</li>
        <li>The image's <strong>intrinsic width in pixels</strong> (in this case, <kbd>480w</kbd>)--note that this uses the <kbd>w</kbd> unit and not the <kbd>px</kbd> unit. An image's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size">intrinsic size</a> is its real size, which can be found by inspecting the image file on your computer</li>
      </ol>
      <li><kbd><strong>sizes</strong></kbd> defines a set of media conditions (e.g., screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true--these are the hints we talked about earlier. In this case, before each comma we write:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>A <strong>media condition</strong> (<kbd>(max-width:600px)</kbd>)--you'll learn more about these in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">CSS topic</a>, but for now, we'll just say that a media condition describes a possible state that the screen can be in. In this case, we are saying "when the viewport width is 600px or less."</li>
        <li>A space</li>
        <li>The <strong>width of the slot</strong> the image will fill when the media condition is true (<kbd>480px</kbd>).</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Note</strong>: For the slot width, rather than providing an absolute width (for example, <kbd>480px</kbd>), you can alternatively provide a width relative to the viewport (for example, <kbd>50vw</kbd>)--but not a percentage. You may have noticed that the last slot width has no media condition (this is the default that is chosen when none of the media conditions are true). The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful how you order the media conditions.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <p>With these attributes in place, the browser will:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Look at screen size, pixel density, zoom level, screen orientation, and network speed.</li>
      <li>Work out which media condition in the <kbd>sizes</kbd> list is the first one to be true.</li>
      <li>Look at the slot size given to that media query.</li>
      <li>Load the image referenced in the <kbd>srcset</kbd> list that has the same size as the slot, or, if there isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And that's it! At this point, if a supporting browser with a viewport width of 480px loads the page, the (<kbd>max-width: 600px</kbd>) media condition will be true, and so the browser chooses the <kbd>480px</kbd> slot. The <kbd>elva-fairy-480w.jpg</kbd> will be loaded, as its inherent width (<kbd>480w</kbd>) is closest to the slot size. The 800px picture is 128 on disk, whereas the 480px version is only 63KB--a saving of 65KB. If this was a page that had several pictures on it, these savings would add up and save users a lot of bandwidth.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note</strong>: When testing this with a desktop browser, if the browser fails to load the narrower images when you've got its window set to the narrowest width, have a look at what the viewport is (you can approximate it by going into the browser's JavaScript console and typing <kbd>document.querySelector('html').clientWidth</kbd>). Different browsers have minimum sizes they'll let you reduce the window width to, and they might be wider than you'd think. When testing it with a mobile browser, you can use tools like Firefox's <kbd>about:debugging</kbd> page to inspect the page loaded on the mobile device using the desktop developer tools.<br><br>To see which images were loaded, you can use Firefox DevTools's <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/index.html">Network Monitor</a> tab or Chrome DevTools's <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/">Network</a> panel. For Chrome, you may also want to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7000899/13725861">disable cache</a> to prevent it from picking already downloaded images.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Older browsers that don't support these features will just ignore them. Instead, those browsers will go ahead and load the image referenced in the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#src">src</a></kbd> attribute as normal.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note</strong>: In the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head">&lt;head&gt;</a></kbd> of the example above, you'll find the line <kbd>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</kbd>. This forces mobile browsers to adopt their real viewport width for loading web pages (some mobile browsers lie about their viewport width, and instead load the pages at a larger viewport width then shrink the loaded page down, which is not very helpful for responsive images or design).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Resolution switching: Same size, different resolutions</h3>
    <p>If you're supporting multiple display resolutions, but everyone sees your image at the same real-world size on the screen, you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using <kbd>srcset</kbd> with x-descriptors and without <kbd>sizes</kbd>--a somewhat easier syntax. You can find an example of what this looks like in <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/srcset-resolutions.html">srcset-resolutions.html</a> (source code <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/srcset-resolutions.html">here</a>).</p>
<code><pre><strong>HTML</strong>
&lt;img
  srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg, elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x, elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
  src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" /&gt;</pre></code>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images/resolution-example.png" width="400">
    <p>In this example, the following CSS is applied to the image so that it will have a width of 320px on the screen (also called CSS pixels):</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
img {
  width: 320px;
}</pre></code>
    <p>In this case, <kbd>sizes</kbd> is not needed--the browser works out what resolution the display is that it is being shown on, and serves the most appropriate image referenced in the <kbd>srcset</kbd>. So, if the device accessing the page has a standard/low resolution display, with one device pixel representing each CSS pixel, the <kbd>elva-fairy-320w.jpg</kbd> image will be loaded (the 1x is implied, so you don't need to include it). If the device has a high resolution of two device pixels per CSS pixel or more, the <kbd>elva-fairy-640w.jpg</kbd> image will be loaded. The 640px image is 93KB, whereas the 320px image is only 39KB.</p>
    <h3>Art direction</h3>
    <p>To recap, <strong>art direction</strong> involves wanting to change the image displayed to suit different image display sizes. For example, a web page includes a large landscape shot with a person in the middle when viewed on a desktop. When viewed on mobile, that same image is shrunk down, making the person in the image very small and hard to see. It would probably be better to show a smaller, portrait image on mobile, which zooms in on the person. The <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture">&lt;picture&gt;</a></kbd> element allows us to implement this kind of solution.</p>
    <p>Returning to our original <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/not-responsive.html">not-responsive.html</a> example from above, we have an image that badly needs art direction:</p>
<code><pre><strong>HTML</strong>
&lt;img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" /&gt;</pre></code>
    <p>Let's fix this with <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture">&lt;picture&gt;</a></kbd>. Like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content"><kbd>&lt;video&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;audio&gt;</kbd></a>, the <kbd>&lt;picture&gt;</kbd> element is a wrapper containing several <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source">&lt;source&gt;</a></kbd> elements that provide different sources for the browser to choose from, followed by the all-important <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img">&lt;img&gt;</a></kbd> element. The code in <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/responsive.html">responsive.html</a> looks like so:</p>
<code><pre><strong>HTML</strong>
&lt;picture&gt;
  &lt;source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg" /&gt;
  &lt;source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg" /&gt;
  &lt;img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" /&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;</pre></code>
    <ul>
      <li>The <kbd>&lt;source&gt;</kbd> elements include a <kbd> media</kbd> attribute that contains a media condition--as with the first <kbd>srcset</kbd> example, these conditions are tests that decide which image is shown--the first one that returns true will be displayed. In this case, if the viewport width is 799px wide or less, the first<kbd>&lt;source&gt;</kbd> element's image will be displayed. If the viewport width is 800px or larger, it'll be the second one.</li>
      <li>The <kbd>srcset</kbd> attributes contain the path to the image to display. Just as we saw with <kbd>&lt;img&gt;</kbd> above, <kbd>&lt;source&gt;</kbd> can take a <kbd>srcset</kbd> attribute with multiple images referenced, as well as a <kbd>sizes</kbd> attribute. So, you could offer multiple resolutions of each one. Realistically, you probably won't want to do this kind of thing very often.</li>
      <li>In all cases, you must provide an <kbd>&lt;img&gt;</kbd> element, with <kbd>src</kbd> and <kbd>alt</kbd>, right before <kbd>&lt;/picture&gt;</kbd>. Otherwise, no images will appear. This provides a default case that will apply when none of the media conditions return true (you could actually remove the second <kbd>&lt;source&gt;</kbd> element in this example), and a fallback for older browsers that don't support the <kbd>&lt;picture&gt;</kbd> element.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This code allows us to display a suitable image on both wide and narrow screen displays, as shown below:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images/picture-element-wide.png" width="400">
    <br>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images/picture-element-narrow.png">
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: You should use the <kbd>media</kbd> attribute in art direction scenarios only; when you use <kbd>media</kbd>, don't also offer media conditions within the <kbd>sizes</kbd> attribute.</p>
    <h3>Why can't we just use CSS or JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>When the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download (preload) any images before the main parser has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. This mechanism is useful in general for reducing page load times, but it is not helpful for responsive images--hence th need to implement solutions like <kbd>srcset</kbd>. For example, you couldn't load the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img">&lt;img&gt;</a></kbd> element, then detect the viewport width with JavaScript, and then dynamically change the source image to a smaller one if desired. By then, the original image would already have been loaded, and you would load the small image as well, which is even worse in terms of responsive images.</p>

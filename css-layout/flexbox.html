    <h2>Why flexbox?</h2>
    <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were features like <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats">floats</a></kbd> and <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning">positioning</a></kbd>. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating.</p>
    <p>The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
      <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.</li>
      <li>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you'll see in this section, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier.</p>
    <h2>Introducing a simple example</h2>
    <p>In this article, you'll work through a series of exercises to help you understand how flexbox works. You should make a local copy of the first <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox0.html">starter file</a> for this reason. You can access your local copy of this page by going <a href="./flexbox-sample.html">here</a>. <strong>NOTE that all of the things you learn in this article are actually implemented on your copy of the sample page, and can be commented in/out as necessary to implement them. They are separated based on which section of this page they refer to.</strong></p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/bih741v.png" width="800">
    <p>You'll see that we have a <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header">&lt;header&gt;</a></kbd> element with a top level heading inside it and a <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section">&lt;section&gt;</a></kbd> element containing three <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd>s. We're going to use these to create a fairly standard three column layout.</p>
    <h2>Specifying what elements to lay out as flexible boxes</h2>
    <p>To start with, we need to select which elements are to be laid out as flexible boxes. To do this, we set a special value of <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display">display</a></kbd> on the parent element of the elements we want to affect. In this case, we want to lay out the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd> elements, so we set this on the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section">&lt;section&gt;</a></kbd>:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
<strong>section {
  display: flex;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>This causes the &lt;section&gt; element to become a <strong>flex container</strong> and its children to become <strong>flex items</strong>. The result should look something like this:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example2.png" width="800">
    <p>So, this single declaration gives us everything we need. We have our column layout with equal-sized columns, and the columns are all the same height. This is because the default values given to flex items (the children of the flex container) are set up to solve common problems such as this.</p>
    <p>Let's reiterate what's happening here. The element we've given a <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display">display</a></kbd> value of <kbd>flex</kbd> to is acting like a block-level element in terms of how it interacts with the rest of the page, but its children are laid out as flex items. The next section will explain what this means in more detail. Note that you can also use a <kbd>display</kbd> value of <kbd>inline-flex</kbd> if you wish to lay out an element's children as flex items, but have that element behave like an inline element.</p>
    <h2>The flex model</h2>
    <p>When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along two axes:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flex_terms.png">
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>main axis</strong> is the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in (for example, as a row across the page, or a column down the page). The start and end of this axis are called the <strong>main start</strong> and <strong>main end</strong>.</li>
      <li>The <strong>cross axis</strong> is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are called the <strong>cross start</strong> and <strong>cross end</strong>.</li>
      <li>The parent element that has <kbd>display: flex</kbd> set on it (the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section">&lt;section&gt;</a></kbd> in our example) is called the <strong>flex container</strong>.</li>
      <li>The items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container are called <strong>flex items</strong> (the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd> elements in our example).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bear this terminology in mind as you go through subsequent sections.</p>
    <h2>Columns or rows?</h2>
    <p>Flexbox provides a property called <kbd><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction">flex-direction</a></strong></kbd> that specifies which direction the main axis runs (aka which direction the flexbox children are laid out in). By default this is set to <kbd>row</kbd>, which causes them to be laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default language works in (left to right in the case of English).</p>
    <p>Try adding the following declaration to your <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section">&lt;section&gt;</a></kbd> rule:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
  flex-direction: column;</pre></code>
    <p>You'll see that this puts the items back in a column layout, much like they were before we added any CSS. Before you move on, comment out this declaration from your example.</p>
    <p><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> you can also lay out flex items in a reverse direction using the <kbd><strong>row-reverse</strong></kbd> and <kbd><strong>column-reverse</strong></kbd> values. Try experimenting with these values, too!</p>
    <h2>Wrapping</h2>
    <p>One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in your layout is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow their container, breaking the layout. Look at MDN's sample <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox-wrap0.html">flexbox wrap page</a>, which you can find a copy of <a href="./flexbox-wrap-sample.html">here</a>. <strong>NOTE that CSS applied in this section of the article is done on the flex-wrap-sample page. Assume this is the case for any CSS introduced alongside a new page that MDN asks you to make a copy of, or in the event you can't find CSS you're looking for on the main flexbox sample page <a href="./flexbox-sample.html">here</a></strong>.</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example3.png" width="800">
    <p>Here we see that the children are indeed breaking out of their container. One way in which you can fix this is to add the following declaration to your <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section">&lt;section&gt;</a></kbd> rule:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
flex-wrap: wrap;</strong></pre></code>
    <p>Also, add the following declaration to your <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd> rule:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
flex: 200px;</strong></pre></code>
    <p>Try this now. You'll see that the layout looks much better with this included:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example4.png" width="800">
    <p>We now have multiple rows. Each row has as many flexbox children fitted into it as is sensible. Any overflow is moved down to the next line. The <kbd>flex: 200px</kbd> declaration set on the articles means that each will be at least 200px wide. We'll discuss this property in more detail later on. You might also notice that the last few children on the last row are each made wider so that the entire row is still filled.</p>
    <p>But there's more we can do here. First of all, try changing your <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction">flex-direction</a></kbd> value to <kbd>row-reverse</kbd>. You'll see that you still have your multiple row layout, but it starts from the opposite corner of the browser window and flows in reverse.</p>
    <h2>flex-flow shorthand</h2>
    <p><strong>Quick tip</strong>: shorthand exists for <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction">flex-direction</a></kbd> and <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap">flex-wrap</a></kbd>: <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-flow"><strong>flex-flow</strong></a></kbd>. So, for example, you can replace the following declarations</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
flex-direction: row;
flex-wrap: wrap;</strong></pre></code>
    <p>with the following:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
flex-flow: row wrap;</strong></pre></code>
    <h2>Flexible sizing of flex items</h2>
    <p>Let's now return to our <a href="./flexbox-sample"> flexbox-sample page</a>.</p>
    <p>First, add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
article {
  flex: 1;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>This is a unitless proportion value that dictates how much available space along the main axis each flex item will take up compared to other flex items. In this case, we're giving each <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd> element the same value (a value of 1), which means they'll all take up an equal amount of the spare space left after properties like padding and margin have been set. This value is proportionally shared among the flex items: giving each flex item a value of 400,000 would have exactly the same effect.</p>
    <p>Now add the following rule below the previous one you added:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
article:nth-of-type(3) {
  flex: 2;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>Now when you refresh, you'll see that the third <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd> takes up twice as much of the available width as the other two. There are now four proportion units available in total (since 1 + 1 + 2 = 4). The first two flex items have one unit each, so they each take 1/4 of the available space. The third one has two units, so it takes up 2/4 (or one-half) of the available space.</p>
    <p>You can also specify a minimum size value within the flex value. Try updating your existing article rules to:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
article {
  flex: 1 200px;
}

article:nth-of-type(3) {
  flex: 2 200px;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>This basically states that "each flex item will be given 200px of the available space. After that, the rest of the available space will be shared according to the proportion units." Try refreshing and you'll see a difference in how the space is shared.</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example1.png" width="800">
    <p>The real value of flexbox can be seen in its flexibility/responsiveness. If you resize the browser window or add another <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd> element, the layout continues to work just fine.</p>
    <h2>flex: shorthand vs longhand</h2>
    <p><kbd><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex">flex</a></strong></kbd> is a shorthand property that can specify up to three different values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The unitless proportion value discussed above. This can be specified separately using the <kbd><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow">flex-grow</a></strong></kbd> long-hand property.</li>
      <li>A second unitless proportion value, <kbd><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink">flex-shrink</a></strong></kbd>, which comes into play when the flex items are overflowing their container. This value specifies how much an item will shrink in order to prevent overflow. This is an advanced flexbox feature and won't be covered further in this module.</li>
      <li>The minimum size value discussed above. This can be specified separately using <kbd><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis">flex-basis</a></strong></kbd> longhand value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>MDN generally advises against using the longhand flex properties <em>unless</em> you have to (e.g., to override something previously set). They lead to a lot of extra code being written and can be somewhat confusing.</p>
    <h2>Horizontal and vertical alignment</h2>
    <p>You can also use flexbox features to align flex items along the main or cross axis. Let's explore this using <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flex-align0.html">this example code</a>, which I've saved as <a href="./flexbox-align-sample.html">a local file here</a>.</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example5.png">
    <p>First, add the following to the bottom of the example's CSS:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-around;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>This will result in the following:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox_center_space-around.png" width="600">
    <p>The buttons are now nicely centered horizontally and vertically. We've done this using two new properties.</p>
    <p><kbd><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items">align-items</a></strong></kbd> controls where the flex items sit on the cross axis.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The default value for this property is <kbd>stretch</kbd>. This stretches all flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the cross axis. If the parent doesn't have a fixed height in the cross axis direction, then all flex items will become as tall as the tallest flex item. This is how our first example had columns of equal height by default.</li>
      <li>The <kbd>center</kbd> value that we used in our above code causes the items to maintain their intrinsic dimensions, but be centered along the cross axis. This is why our current example's buttons are centered vertically.</li>
      <li>You can also have values like <kbd>flex-start</kbd> and <kbd>flex-end</kbd>, which will align all items at the start and end of the cross axis respectively. See <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items">align-items</a></kbd> for further details.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can override the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items">align-items</a></kbd> behavior for <strong>individual flex items</strong> by applying the <kbd><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self">align-self</a></strong></kbd> property to them. For example, try adding the following to your CSS:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
button:first-child {
  align-self: flex-end; 
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>This will have the following result:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox_first-child_flex-end.png" width="600">
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: the module says to remove this from your CSS once you've seen the effect it has, so I've commented it out on my local copy.</p>    
    <p><kbd><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content">justify-content</a></strong></kbd> controls <strong>where the flex items sit</strong> on the <strong>main axis</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The default value is <kbd>flex-start</kbd>, which makes all the items sit at the start of the main axis.</li>
      <li>You can use <kbd>flex-end</kbd> to make all the items sit at the end.</li>
      <li><kbd>center</kbd> is also a value accepted by the <kbd>justify-content</kbd> property. It'll make the flex items sit in the center of the main axis.</li>
      <li>The value we've used above, <kbd>space-around</kbd>, is useful--it distributes all the items evenly along the main axis with a bit of space left at either end.</li>
      <li>There is another value, <kbd>space-between</kbd>, which is similar to <kbd>space-around</kbd> except it doesn't leave any space at either end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <kbd><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-items">justify-items</a></strong></kbd> property is <strong>ignored in flexbox</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Ordering flex items</h2>
    <p>Flexbox also has a feature for changing the layout order of flex items without affecting the source order. This is another ting that is impossible to do with traditional layout methods.</p>
    <p>Add the following CSS to your button bar example on this <a href="./flexbox-align-sample.html">page</a>.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
button:first-child {
  order: 1;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>Refresh the page and you'll see that the "Smile" button has moved to the end of the main axis. Let's talk about how this works in more detail:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All flex items have an <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order">order</a></kbd> value of 0 by default.</li>
      <li>Flex items with <strong>higher specified order values</strong> will appear later in the display order than items with lower order values.</li>
      <li>Flex items with <strong>the same order value</strong> will appear in their source order. So, if you have four items whose order values have been set as 2, 1, 1, and 0, respectively, their display order would be 4th, 2nd, 3rd, then 1st.</li>
      <li>The 3rd item appears after the 2nd because it has the same order value and is after it in the source order (I believe this applies to the bullet point directly before this one).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can set negative order values to make items appear earlier than items whose value is 0. For example, you could make the "Blush" button appear at the start of the main axis using the following rule:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
button:last-child {
  order: -1;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <h2>Nested flex boxes</h2>
    <p>It's also possible to create some pretty complex layouts with flexbox. It's perfectly okay to set a flex item to also be a flex container, so that its children are also laid out like flexible boxes. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/complex-flexbox.html">MDN's example here</a>, which I've saved a <a href="./flexbox-complex-sample.html">local copy of here</a>.</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example7.png" width="800">
    <p>The HTML for this is fairly simple. We've got a <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section">&lt;section&gt;</a></kbd> element containing three <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd>s. The third <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd> contains three <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">&lt;div&gt;</a></kbd>s, and the first <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">&lt;div&gt;</a></kbd> contains five <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button">&lt;button&gt;</a></kbd>s:</p>
<code><pre>
  section - article
  article
  article - div - button
            div   button
            div   button
                  button
                  button</pre></code>
    <p>Let's look at the code we've used for the layout.</p>
    <p>First of all, we set the children of the <kbd>&lt;section&gt;</kbd> to be laid out as flexible boxes:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
section {
  display: flex;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>Next, we set some flex values on the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd>s themselves. Take special note of the second rule here: we're setting the third <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">&lt;article&gt;</a></kbd> to have its children laid out like flex items, too, but this time we're laying them out as a column:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
article {
  flex: 1 200px;
}

article:nth-of-type(3) {
  flex: 3 200px;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>Next, we select the first <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">&lt;div&gt;</a></kbd>. We first use <kbd>flex: 1 100px;</kbd> to effectively give it a minimum height of 100px, then we set its children (the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button">&lt;button&gt;</a></kbd> elements) to also be laid out like flex items. Here we lay them out in a wrapping row and align them in the center of the available space as we did with the individual button example we saw earlier.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
article:nth-of-type(3) div:first-child {
  flex: 1 100px;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-around;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <p>Finally, we set some sizing on the button. This time by giving it a <kbd>flex</kbd> value of <kbd>1 auto</kbd>. This has a very interesting effect, which you'll see if you try resizing your browser window width. The buttons will take up as much space as they can. As many will fit on a line as is comfortable; beyond that, they'll drop to a new line.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS
button {
  flex: 1 auto;
  margin: 5px;
  font-size: 18px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}</strong></pre></code>
    <h2>Cross-browser compatibility</h2>
    <p>Flexbox support is available in most new browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and IE 11, newer versions of Android/iOS, etc. However, you should be aware that there are still older browsers in use that don't support Flexbox (or do, but support a really old, out-of-date version of it.)</p>
    <p>If you're considering using flexbox in a real website, you need to do testing and make sure that your user experience is still acceptable in as many browsers as possible.</p>
    <p>Flexbox is a bit trickier than some CSS features. For example, if a browser is missing a CSS drop shadow, then the site will likely still be usable. Not supporting flexbox features, however, will probably break a layout completely, making it unusable.</p>
    <p>We discuss strategies for overcoming cross-browser support issues in our <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing">Cross browser testing</a></kbd> module.</p>

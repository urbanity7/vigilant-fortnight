    <h2>Media query basics</h2>
    <p>CSS media queries allow to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example, "viewport is wider than 480 pixels." They are used for responsive web design and other functionalities.</p>
    <p><strong>Syntax</strong>:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media media-type and (media-feature-rule) {
  /* CSS rules go here */
}</pre></code>
    <p>The basic components of a media query are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A media type, which tells the browser what kind of media this code is for (e.g., print, screen).</li>
      <li>A media expression, which is a rule or test that must be passed for the contained CSS to be applied.</li>
      <li>A set of CSS rules that will be applied if the test passes and the media type is correct.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Media types</h3>
    <p>The possible types of media you can specify are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><kbd>all</kbd></li>
      <li><kbd>print</kbd></li>
      <li><kbd>screen</kbd></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following media query will set the body to 12pt if the page is printed. It won't be applied if the page isn't printed.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media print {
  body {
    font-size: 12pt;
  }
}</pre></code>
    <p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The media type here is different from the so-called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type">MIME type</a>.</li>
      <li>There were a number of other media types defined in the level 3 media queries specification; these have been deprecated and should be avoided.</li>
      <li>Media types are optional; if you do not indicate a media type in your media query, then the media query will default to being for all media types.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Media feature rules</h3>
    <p>After specifying the type, you can then target a media feature with a rule.</p>
    <p><strong>Width and height</strong></p>
    <p>The feature we tend to detect most in terms of RWD is viewport width. We can apply CSS if the viewport is above or below a certain width--or an exact width--using the <kbd>min-width</kbd>, <kbd>max-width</kbd>, and <kbd>width</kbd> media features.</p>
    <p>These features are used to create layouts that respond to different screen sizes. For example, to change the body text color to red if the viewport is exactly 600px, you would use the following media query:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media screen and (width: 600px) {
  body {
    color: red;
  }
}

<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/width.html">Live example</a> and <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/width.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <p>The <kbd>width</kbd> (and <kbd>height</kbd>) media features can also be used as ranges, and therefore be prefixed with <kbd>min-</kbd> or <kbd>max-</kbd> to indicate that the given value is a minimum/maximum. For example, to make the color blue if the viewport is 600px or narrower, use <kbd>max-width</kbd>:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    color: blue;
  }
}

<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/max-width.html">Live example</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/max-width.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <p>In practice, using minimum or maximum values is much more useful for RWD, so you'll rarely see <kbd>width</kbd> or <kbd>height</kbd> used alone without a prefix.</p>
    <p><strong>To see other media features that you can test for, visit the following <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries#syntax">page</a></strong>.</p>    
    <p><strong>Orientation</strong></p>
    <p>One well-supported media feature is <kbd>orientation</kbd>, which allows us to test for portrait or landscape orientations. To change the body text color if the device is in landscape orientation, use the following media query:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    color: rebeccapurple;
  }
}

<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/orientation.html">Live example</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/orientation.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <p>A standard desktop view has a landscape orientation, and a design that works well in this orientation may not work as well when viewed on a phone or tablet in portrait mode. Therefore, testing for orientation can help you create a layout that's optimized for devices in portrait mode.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of pointing devices</strong></p>
    <p>The <kbd>hover</kbd> media feature was introduced as part of the level 4 specification. This feature allows you to test if the user has the ability to hover over an element, which essentially means that they are using some kind of pointing device (touchscreen and keyboard navigation doesn't hover).</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media (hover: hover) {
  body {
    color: rebeccapurple;
  }
}

<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/hover.html">Live example</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/hover.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <p>If we know the user cannot hover, we could display some interactive features by default. For users who can hover, we might choose to make them available when a link is hovered over.</p>
    <p>Also in level 4 is the <kbd>pointer</kbd> media feature. This takes three possible values--<kbd>none</kbd>, <kbd>fine</kbd>, and <kbd>coarse</kbd>. A <kbd>fine</kbd> pointer is something like a mouse or trackpad. It enables the user to precisely target a small area. A <kbd>coarse</kbd> pointer is your finger on a touchscreen. The value <kbd>none</kbd> means the user has no pointing device; perhaps they are navigating with only a keyboard or with voice commands.</p>
    <p>Using <kbd>pointer</kbd> can help you design better interfaces that respond to the type of interaction a user is having with a screen. For example, you could create larger hit areas if you know that the user is interacting with the device as a touchscreen.</p>
    <p><strong>Using ranged syntax</strong></p>
    <p>One common case is to check if the viewport width is between two values:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media (min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 50em) {
  /* ... *
}</pre></code>
    <p>If you want to improve the readability of this, you can use "range" syntax:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media (30em &lt;= width &lt;= 50em) {
  /* ... */
}</pre></code>
    <p>In this case, styles are applied when the viewport width is between <kbd>30em</kbd> and <kbd>50em</kbd>. For more information on using this style, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries#syntax_improvements_in_level_4">this page</a>.</p>
    <h2>More complex media queries</h2>
    <p>With all of the different possible media queries, you may want to comebine them or create lists of queries--any of which could be matched.</p>
    <h3>"and" logic in media queries</h3>
    <p>To combine media features, you can use <kbd>and</kbd> in much the same way as we have used <kbd>and</kbd> above to combine a media type and feature. For example, we might want to test for a <kbd>min-width</kbd> and <kbd>orientation</kbd>. The body text will only be blue if the viewport is at least 600px wide and the device is in landscape mode.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    color: blue;
  }
}

<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/and.html">Live example</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/and.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <h3>"or" logic in media queries</h3>
    <p>If you have a set of media queries, any of which could match, then you can comma separate these queries. In the below example, the text will be blue if the viewport is at least 600px wide OR the device is in landscape orientation. If either of these things are true, the query matches and will be applied:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media screen and (min-width: 600px), screen and (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    color: blue;
  }
}

<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/or.html">Live example</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/or.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <h3>"not" logic in media queries</h3>
    <p>You can negate an entire media query by using the <kbd>not</kbd> operator. This reverses the meaning of the entire media query. Therefore, the text in the next example will only be blue if the orientation is portrait:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media not all and (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    color: blue;
  }
}

<a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/not.html">Live example</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/not.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <h2>How to choose breakpoints</h2>
    <p>In the early days of responsive design, many designers would attempt to target specific screen sizes. Obviously, there are far too many screen sizes today to do this. This means that instead of targeting specific sizes for all designs, a better approach is to change the design at the size where the content starts to break in some way. Perhaps the line lengths become far too long, or a boxed out sidebar gets squashed and becomes hard to read. That's the point at which you want to use a media query to change the design to a better one for the space you have available. This approach means that it doesn't matter what the exact dimensions are of the device being used, as every range is catered for. The points at which a media query is introduced are called <strong>breakpoints</strong>.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/responsive_design_mode/index.html">Responsive Design Mode</a> in Firefox DevTools is very useful for working out where these breakpoints should go. You can easily make the viewport smaller and larger to see where the content would be improved by adding a media query and tweaking the design.</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries/rwd-mode.png" width="500">
    <h2>Active learning: mobile-first responsive design</h2>
    <p>You  can take two approaches to web design. You can start with your desktop or widest view and then add breakpoints to move things around as the viewport becomes smaller, or you can start with the smallest view and add layout as the viewport becomes larger. This second approach is known as <strong>mobile-first</strong> RWD and is generally the best approach to follow.</p>
    <p>The view for the very smallest devices is quite often a single column of content, much as it appears in normal flow. This means that you probably don't need to do a lot of layout for small devices--order your source well and you will have a readable layout by default.</p>
    <p>The below walkthrough takes you through this mobile-first approach with a very simple layout. In a production site, you are likely to have more things to adjust within your media queries--however, the approach would remain exactly the same.</p>
    <h3>Walkthrough: a simple mobile-first layout</h3>
    <p>Local example is available <a href="media-queries-sample.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Our starting point is an HTML document with some CSS applied to add background colors to various parts of the layout.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  width: 90%;
  margin: 2em auto;
  font:
    1em/1.3 Arial,
    Helvetica,
    sans-serif;
}

a:link,
a:visited {
  color: #333;
}

nav ul,
aside ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

nav a:link,
nav a:visited {
  background-color: rgb(207 232 220 / 20%);
  border: 2px solid rgb(79 185 227);
  text-decoration: none;
  display: block;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
  font-weight: bold;
}

nav a:hover {
  background-color: rgb(207 232 220 / 70%);
}

.related {
  background-color: rgb(79 185 227 / 30%);
  border: 1px solid rgb(79 185 227);
  padding: 10px;
}

.sidebar {
  background-color: rgb(207 232 220 / 50%);
  padding: 10px;
}

article {
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}</pre></code>
    <p>We've made no layout changes, however the source of the document is ordered in a way that makes the content readable. This is an important first step and one which ensures that if the content were to be read out by a screen reader, it would be understandable.</p>
<code><pre><strong>HTML</strong>
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
      &lt;nav&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Meet the team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
      &lt;article&gt;
        &lt;div class="content"&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Veggies!&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;aside class="related"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/aside&gt;
      &lt;/article&gt;

      &lt;aside class="sidebar"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;External vegetable-based links&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/aside&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;footer&gt;&lt;p&gt;&copy;2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

See <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/step1.html">step one in action here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/step1.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <p>This simple layout also works well on mobile. If we view the layout in Responsive Design Mode in DevTools, we can see that it works pretty well as a straightforward mobile view of the site.</p>
    <p>From this point, start to drag the Responsive Design Mode view wider until you can see that the line lengths are becoming quite long, and that we have space for the navigation to display in a horizontal line. This is where we'll add our first media query. We'll use <kbd>em</kbd>s, as this will mean that if the user has increased their text size, the breakpoint will happen at a similar line-length but wider viewport, than someone with a smaller text size.</p>
    <p><strong>Add the below code to the bottom of your <a href="media-queries-sample.html">media-queries-sample.html CSS</a>.</strong></p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
  article {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr;
    column-gap: 20px;
  }

  nav ul {
    display: flex;
  }

  nav li {
    flex: 1;
  }
}

See <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/step2.html">step two in action here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/step2.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <p>This CSS gives us a two-column layout inside the article, of the article content and related information in the aside element. We have also used flexbox to put the navigation into a row.</p>
    <p>Let's continue to expand the width until we feel there is enough room for the sidebar to also form a new column. Inside a media query, we'll make the main element into a two-column grid. We then need to remove the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-bottom">margin-bottom</a></kbd> on the article in order for the two sidebars to align with each other, and we'll add a <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border">border</a></kbd> to the top of the footer. Typically, these small tweaks are the kind of thing you will do to make the design look good at each breakpoint.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
@media screen and (min-width: 70em) {
  main {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr;
    column-gap: 20px;
  }

  article {
    margin-bottom: 0;
  }

  footer {
    border-top: 1px solid #ccc;
    margin-top: 2em;
  }
}

See <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/step3.html">step three in action here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/step3.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <p>If you look at the final example at different widths, you can see how the design responds and works as a single column, two columns, or three columns, depending on the available width. This is a very simple example of a mobile-first responsive design.</p>
    <h2>The viewport meta tag</h2>
    <p>If you look at the HTML source in the above example, you'll see the following element included in the head of the document:</p>
<code><pre><strong>HTML</strong>
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" /&gt;</pre></code>
    <p>This is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag">viewport meta tag</a>--it exists as a way to control how mobile browsers render content. This is needed because by default, most mobile browsers lie about their viewport width. Non-responsive sites generally look bad when rendered in a narrow viewport, so mobile browsers usually render the site with a viewport wider than the real device width by default (usually 980px), and then shrink the rendered result so that it fits in the display.</p>
    <p>This is all well and good, but it means that responsive sites are not going to work as expected. If the viewport width is reported as 980px, then mobile layouts (for example, created using a media query of <kbd>@media screen and (max-width:600px) { }</kbd>) are not going to render as expected.</p>
    <p>To remedy this, including a viewport meta tag like the one above on your page tells thr browser, "don't render the content with a 980px viewport--render it using the real device width instead, and set a default initial scale level for better consistency." The media queries will then kick in as expected.</p>
    <p>There are a number of options you can put inside the <kbd>content</kbd> attribute of the viewport meta tag--see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag">Using the viewport meta tag to control layout on mobile browsers</a> for more information.</p>
    <h2>Do you really need a media query?</h2>
    <p>Flexbox, grid, and multi-column layouts all give you ways to create flexible and even responsive components without the need for a media query. It's always worth considering whether these layout methods can achieve what you want without adding media queries. For example, you might want a set of cards that are at least 200px wide, with as many of these 200px cards as will fit into the main article. This can be achieved with grid layout, using no media queries whatsoever:</p>
<code><pre><strong>HTML</strong>
  &lt;ul class="grid"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Card 1&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Card 2&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Card 3&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Card 4&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Card 5&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre></code>

<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
.grid {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: grid;
  gap: 20px;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}

.grid li {
  border: 1px solid #666;
  padding: 10px;
}

See <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/media-queries/grid.html">the live example here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/media-queries/grid.html">source code</a>.</pre></code>
    <p>With the example open in your browser, make the screen wider and narrower to see the number of column tracks change. The nice thing about this method is that grid is not looking at the actual viewport width, but the width it has <em>available</em> for this component.</p>
    <p>It might seem weird to wrap up a section about media queries with a comment that you might not need one at all. However, in practice, you will find that good use of modern layout methods, enhanced with media queries, will give the best results.</p>

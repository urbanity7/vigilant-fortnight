    <h2>Precursor to responsive design: mobile web design</h2>
    <p>A responsive web design (RWD) approach focuses on making web pages that render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while maintaining good usability.</p>
    <p>Before RWD, terms like mobile web design, mobile web development, and mobile-friendly design were used to discuss making websites work well across devices with different physical attributes (screen size, resolution) in terms of layout, content (text and media), and performance.</p>
    <h2>Introducing responsive web design</h2>
    <p>HTML is fundamentally responsive--or fluid--in that web pages that are purely HTML will automatically reflow the text to fit the viewport on pages without CSS. RWD comes into play when CSS is used as it affects how different items display on different devices.</p>
    <h2>Media queries</h2>
    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries">Media queries</a> allow us to run a series of tests (e.g., whether the user's screen is greater than a certain width or a certain resolution) and <strong>apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriate for users' needs</strong>. For example, the following media query tests to see if the current web page is being displayed as screen media (therefore not as a printed document), and whether the viewport is at least <kbd>80rem</kbd> wide. The CSS for the <kbd>.container</kbd> selector will only be applied if these two things are true.</p>
<pre><code><strong>CSS</strong>
@media screen and (min-width: 80rem) {
  .container {
    margin: 1em 2em;
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>You can add multiple media queries within a stylesheet, tweaking your whole layout or parts of it to best suit the various screen sizes. The points at which a media query is introduced, and the layout is changed, are known as <em>breakpoints</em>.</p>
    <p>A common approach when using media queries is to create a simple single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (like smartphones), then check for wider screens and implement a multi-column layout when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it. Designing for mobile first is known as <strong>mobile first design</strong>.</p>
    <p>If using breakpoints, best practices encourage defining media query breakpoints with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#relative_length_units">relative units</a> rather than absolute sizes of an individual device to maintain RWD across devices.</p>
    <p>There are different approaches to the styles defined within a media query block; ranging from using media queries to <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link">&lt;link&gt;</a></kbd> style sheets based on browser size ranges to only including custom properties variables to store values associated with each breakpoint. Find out more in the MDN documentation for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries">media queries</a>.</p>
    <p>Media queries can help with RWD, but are not a requirement. Flexible grids, relative units, and minimum and maximum unit values can be used without media queries.</p>
    <h2>Responsive layout technologies</h2>
    <p>Responsive sites are built on flexible grids, meaning you don't need to target every possible device size with pixel perfect layouts.</p>
    <p>By using a flexible grid, you can change a feature or add in a breakpoint and change the design at the point where the content starts to look bad. For example, to ensure line lengths don't become unreasonably long as the screen size increases, you can use <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/columns">columns</a></kbd>; if a box becomes squashed with two words on each line as it narrows, you can set a breakpoint.</p>
    <p>Several layout methods, including <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Multiple-column_Layout">Multiple-column layout</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">Flexbox</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">Grid</a> are responsive by default. They all assume that you are trying to create a flexible grid and give you easier ways to do so.</p>
    <h3>Multicol</h3>
    <p>With multicol, you specify a <kbd>column-count</kbd> to indicate the maximum number of columns you want your content to be split into. The browser then works out the size of these--a size that will change according to screen size.</p>
<pre><code><strong>CSS</strong>
.container {
  column-count: 3;
}</code></pre>
    <p>If you instead specify a <kbd>column-width</kbd>, you are specifying a <kbd>minimum</kbd> width. The browser will create as many columns of that width as will comfortably fit into the container, then share out the remaining space between all the columns. Therefore, the number of columns will change according to how much space there is.</p>
<pre><code><strong>CSS</strong>
.container {
  column-width: 10em;
}</code></pre>
    <p>You can use the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/columns">columns</a></kbd> shorthand to provide a maximum number of columns and a minimum column width. This can ensure the line lengths don't become unreadably long as the screen size increases or too narrow as the screen size decreases.</p>
    <h3>Flexbox</h3>
    <p>In Flexbox, flex items shrink or grow, distributing space between the items according to the space in their container. By changing the values for <kbd>flex-grow</kbd> and <kbd>flex-shrink</kbd>, you can indicate how you want the items to behave when they encounter more or less space around them.</p>
    <p>In the example below, the flex items will each take an equal amount of space in the flex container, using the shorthand of <kbd>flex: 1;</kbd> as described in the layout topic <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox#flexible_sizing_of_flex_items">Flexbox: Flexible sizing of items</a>.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  flex: 1;
}</pre></code>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: As an example, we have built a simple responsive layout above using flexbox. We use a breakpoint to switch to multiple columns when the screen grows, and limit the size of the main content with <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-width">max-width</a></kbd>: <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/flex-based-rwd.html">example</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/rwd/flex-based-rwd.html">source code</a>.</p>
    <h3>CSS grid</h3>
    <p>In CSS Grid Layout, the <kbd>fr</kbd> unit allows the distribution of available space across grid tracks. The next example creates a grid container with three tracks sized at <kbd>1fr</kbd>. This will create three column tracks, each taking one part of the available space in the container. You can find out more about this approach to create a grid in the Learn Layout Grids topic, under <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids#flexible_grids_with_the_fr_unit">Flexible grids with the fr unit</a>.</p>
<pre><code><strong>CSS</strong>
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The grid layout version is even simpler as we can define the columns on the <kbd>.wrapper</kbd>: <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/grid-based-rwd.html">example</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/rwd/grid-based-rwd.html">source code</a>.</p>
    <h2>Responsive images/media</h2>
    <p>To ensure media is never larger than its responsive container, the following approach can be used:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
img,
picture,
video {
  max-width: 100%;
}</pre></code>
    <p>This scales media to ensure they never overflow their containers. Using a single large image and scaling it down to fit small devices wastes bandwidth by downloading images larger than what is needed.</p>
    <p>Responsive images, using the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture">&lt;picture&gt;</a></kbd> element and the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img">&lt;img&gt;</a></kbd> <kbd>srcset</kbd> and <kbd>sizes</kbd> attributes enables serving images targeted to the user's viewport and the device's resolution. For example, you can include a square image for mobile, but show the same scene as a landscape image on desktop.</p>
    <p>The <kbd>&lt;picture&gt;</kbd> element enables providing multiple sizes along with "hints" (metadata that describes the screen size and resolution the image is best suited for), and the browser will choose the most appropriate image for each device, ensuring that a user will download an image size appropriate for the device they are using. Using <kbd>&lt;picture&gt;</kbd> along with <kbd>max-width</kbd> removes the need for sizing images with media queries. It enables targeting images with different aspect ratios to different viewport sizes.</p>
    <p>You can also <em>art direct</em> images used at different sizes, thus providing a different crop or completely different image to different screen sizes.</p>
    <p>You can find a detailed <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">guide to Responsive Images in the Learn HTML section</a> here on MDN.</p>
    <p>Other useful tips:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always make sure to use an appropriate image format for your website images (such as PNG or JPG), and make sure to optimize the file size using a graphics editor before you put them on your website.</li>
      <li>You can make use of CSS features like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images/Using_CSS_gradients">gradients</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow">shadows</a> to implement visual effects without using images.</li>
      <li>You can use media queries inside the media attribute on <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source">&lt;source&gt;</a></kbd> elements inside <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video">&lt;video&gt;</a></kbd>/<kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio">&lt;audio&gt;</a></kbd> elements to serve video/audio files as appropriate for different devices (responsive video/audio).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Responsive typography</h2>
    <p>Responsive typography describes changing font sizes within media queries or using viewport units to reflect lesser or greater amounts of screen real estate.</p>
    <h3>Using media queries for responsive typography</h3>
    <p>In this example, we want to set our level 1 heading to be <kbd>4rem</kbd>, meaning it will be 4x our base font size. That's a really large heading! We only want this jumbo heading on larger screen sizes; therefore, we first create a smaller heading then use media queries to overwrite it with the larger size if we know that the user has a screen size of at least <kbd>1200px</kbd>.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
html {
  font-size: 1em;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 4rem;
  }
}</pre></code>
    <p>We have edited our responsive grid example above to also include responsive type using the method outlined. You can see how the heading switches sizes as the layout goes to the two column version.</p>
    <p>On mobile, the heading appears smaller:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design/mdn-rwd-font-mobile.png" width="400">
    <p>On desktop, however, we see the larger heading size:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design/mdn-rwd-font-desktop.png" width="600">
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: See this example in action: <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/type-rwd.html">example</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/rwd/type-rwd.html">source code</a></p>
    <p>As this approach to typography shows, you do not need to restrict media queries to only changing the layout of the page. They can be used to tweak any element to make it more usable or attractive at alternate screen sizes.</p>
    <h3>Using viewport units for responsive typography</h3>
    <p>Viewport units <kbd>vw</kbd> can also be used to enable responsive typography, without the need for setting breakpoints with media queries. <kbd>1vw</kbd> is equal to one percent of the viewport width, meaning that if you set your font size using <kbd>vw</kbd>, it will always relate to the size of the viewport.</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
h1 {
  font-size: 6vw;
}</pre></code>
    <p>The problem with doing the above is that the user loses the ability to zoom any text set using the <kbd>vw</kbd> unit, as that text is always related to the size of the viewport. <strong>Therefore, you should never set text using viewport units alone</strong>.</p>
    <p>There is a solution, and it involves using <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc">calc()</a></kbd>. If you add the <kbd>vw</kbd> unit to a value set using a fixed size such as <kbd>em</kbd>s or <kbd>rem</kbd>s, then the text will still be zoomable. Essentially, the <kbd>vw</kbd> adds zoomed value on top of the fixed unit that precedes it:</p>
<code><pre><strong>CSS</strong>
h1 {
  font-size: calc(1.5rem + 3vw);
}</pre></code>
    <p>This means that we only need to specify the font size for the heading once, rather than set it up for mobile and redefine it in the media queries. The font then gradually increases as you increase the size of the viewport.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: See an example of this in action: <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/rwd/type-vw.html">example</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/rwd/type-vw.html">source code</a>.</p>
    <h2>The viewport meta tag</h2>
    <p>If you look at the HTML source of a responsive page, you will usually see the following <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta">&lt;meta&gt;</a></kbd> tag in the <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd> of the document:</p>
<code><pre><strong>HTML</strong>
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" &gt;</pre></code>
    <p>This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag">viewport</a> meta tag tells mobile browser that they should set the width of the viewport to the device width, and scale the document to 100% of its intended size, which shows the document at the mobile-optimized size that you intended.</p>
    <p>Why is this needed? Because mobile browsers tend to lie about their viewport width.</p>
    <p>This meta tag exists because when smartphones first arrived, most sites were not optimized for mobile devices. The mobile browser would therefore set the viewport width the 980 pixels, render the page at that width, and show the result as a zoomed-out version of the desktop layout. Users could zoom in and pan around the website to view the bits they were interested in, but it looked bad.</p>
    <p>By setting <kbd>width=device-width</kbd> you are overriding a mobile device's default, like Apple's default <kbd>width=980px</kbd>, with the actual width of the device. Without it, your responsive design with breakpoints and media queries may not work as intended on mobile browsers. If you've got a narrow screen layout that kicks in at 480px viewport width or less, but the device is saying it is 980px wide, that user will not see your narrow screen layout.</p>
    <p><strong>So, you should <em>always</em> include the viewport meta tag in the head of your documents to best ensure RWD</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Responsive design refers to a site or application design that responds to the environment in which it is viewed. It encompasses a number of HTML and CSS features and techniques, and is now essentially just how we build websites by default. Consider the sites that you visit on your phone--it is probably fairly unusual to come across a site that is the desktop version scaled down, or where you need to scroll sideways to find things. This is because the web has adopted this approach of designing things responsively.</p>
    <p>It has also become much easier to achieve responsive designs with the help of the layout methods you have learned in these lessons. If you are new to web development today, you have many more tools at your disposal than in the early days of responsive design. It is therefore worth checking the age of any materials you are using. While the historical articles are still useful, modern use of CSS and HTML makes it far easier to create elegant and useful designs, no matter what device your visitor views your site with.</p>

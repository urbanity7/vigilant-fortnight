    <h2>What is overflow?</h2>
    <p>Overflow happens when there is too much content to fit in a box. Remember, everything in CSS is a box. Because CSS tries to avoid "data loss," it has a tendency to permit overflow unless otherwise instructed not to.</p>
    <h2>The overflow property</h2>
    <p>The <kbd><strong>overflow</strong></kbd> property is used to control overflow. It is set to <kbd>visible</kbd> by default, which allows overflow to be seen on the frontend. To crop content when it overflows, you can use <kbd>overflow: hidden</kbd>. Because this makes overflow invisible, only use this when you're sure hiding content won't cause problems. Finally, using <kbd>overflow: scroll</kbd> adds scrollbars when content overflows to keep the layout consistent while showing all pertinent content. To scroll on just one axis instead of both, you can use the corresponding property for that axis (e.g., <kbd>overflow-y: scroll</kbd>).</p>

    <h2>The natural or intrinsic size of things</h2>
    <p>HTML elements have a natural size that is set before they are affected by CSS. Consider an image: an image file contains sizing information, described as its <strong>intrinsic size</strong>. This size is determined by the image <em>itself</em>, and not by any formatting we might apply.</p>
    <p>If you place an image on a page and do not change its height or width, either by using attributes on the <kbd>&lt;img&gt;</kbd> tag or by CSS, it will be displayed using its intrinsic size. For example, the following image of the Caps logo uses the original image file's intrinsic size because its size hasn't been altered using CSS (note: the border denotes its total intrinsic size):</p>
    <img src="images\weagle.png" style="border: 5px solid darkblue;">
    <p>An empty <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">&lt;div&gt;</a></kbd>, on the other hand, has no size of its own. If you add a <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> to your HTML with no content and give it a border like we did with the image above, then you will see a line on the page. This is the collapsed border on the element--there is no content to hold it open. In the example below, that border stretches to the width of the container because it is a block level element--it has no height (or size in the block dimension) because there is no content:</p>
    <div class="box1-css-sizing" style="border: 5px solid darkblue;"></div>
    <p>However, if you add some text inside the empty <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> element, the border now contains that text because the height of the element is defined by the content. Therefore, the size of this <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> in the block dimension comes from the size of the content. Again, this is the <strong>intrinsic size of the element--its size defined by its content.</strong></p>
    <div class="box1-css-sizing" style="border: 5px solid darkblue;">Example</div>
    <h2>Setting a specific size</h2>
    <p><strong>Extrinsic size</strong> refers to when you give an element a specific size. Consider the <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> from above--we can give it specific <kbd>width</kbd> and <kbd>height</kbd> values, and it will now have that size no matter what content is placed into it. As we discovered in the overflow lesson, a set height can cause content to overflow if there's more content than the element has space to fit inside it. Due to this problem of overflow, fixing the height of elements with lengths or percentages is something we need to do with caution.</p>
    <div class="wrapper-5">
      <div class="box-5"></div>
      <br>
      <div class="box-5">These boxes both have a height set. This box has content in it which will need more space than the assigned height, so we get overflow as a result.</div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    <h3>Using percentages</h3>
    <p>Percentages act like length units in many ways, and they can often be used interchangeably with lengths. When using a percentage, you need to be aware what it is a percentage <em>of</em>. In the case of a box inside another container, if you give the child box a percentage width it will be a percentage of the width of the parent container.</p>
    <div class="box-6">I have a percentage width.</div>
    <p><strong>This is because percentages resolve against the size of the containing block</strong>. With no percentage applied, our <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> would take up 100% of the available space, as it is a block level element. If we give it a percentage width, this becomes a percentage of the space it would normally fill.</p>
    <h3>Percentage margins and padding</h3>
    <p>If you set <kbd>margins</kbd> and <kbd>padding</kbd> as a percentage, you may notice some strange behavior. In the example below we have a box. We have given the inner box a <kbd>margin</kbd> of 10% and a <kbd>padding</kbd> of 10%. The padding a margin on the top and bottom of the box are the same size as the padding and margin on the left and right.</p>
    <div class="box-7">I have margin and padding set to 10% on all sides.</div>
    <p>You might expect the percentage top and bottom margins, for example, to be a percentage of the element's height, and the percentage left and right margins to be a percentage of the element's width. <strong>This is not the case</strong>.</p>
    <p>When you use margin and padding set in percentages, the value is calculated from the <strong>inline size</strong> of the containing block--or the width when working in a horizontal language. In our example, all of the margins and padding are 10% of the width. This means you can have equal-sized margins and padding all around the box. Keep this in mind if you use percentages.</p>
    <h2>Min- and max- sizes</h2>
    <p>In addition to giving things a fixed size, CSS can be used to give an element a minimum or a maximum size. If you have a box that might contain a variable amount of content, and you always want it to be <em>at least</em> a certain height, you could set the <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-height">min-height</a></kbd> property on it. The box will always be at least this height, but will then grow taller if there is more content than the box has space for at its minimum height. Both of the boxes below have a <kbd>min-height</kbd> of 75px. Because the box on the right has content that needs more room, it grows taller to accommodate this extra content.</p>
    <div class="wrapper-6">
      <div class="box-8"></div>
      <br>
      <div class="box-8">These boxes both have a minimum height set. Because this box has more content in it, it needs more space than the assigned minimum height, and thus grows larger to accommodate this extra content.</div>
    </div>
    <p>This ability to set minimum and maximum sizes is therefore very useful when dealing with overflow.</p>
    <p>A common use of <kbd><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-width">max-width</a></kbd> is to cause images to scale down if there is not enough space to display them at their intrinsic width, while also ensuring they don't become larger than this width. As an example, if you were to set <kbd>width: 100%</kbd> on an image, and its intrinsic width was smaller than its container, the image would be forced to stretch and become larger, therefore causing it to look pixelated. If you instead use <kbd>max-width: 100%</kbd>, and its intrinsic width is smaller than its container, the image will not be forced to stretch and become larger, allowing you to avoid pixelating the image.</p>
    <p>In the example below, we have used the same image three times. The first image has been given <kbd>width: 100%</kbd> and is in a container which is larger than it. It therefore stretches to the container width. The second image has <kbd>max-with: 75%</kbd> set on it, and thus does not stretch to fill the container. The third box contains the same image again, also width <kbd>max-width: 100%</kbd> set; in this case, you can see how it has scaled down to fit the box.</p>
    <div class="wrapper-7">
      <div class="box-9"><img src="images\weagle.png" class="width"></div>
      <br>
      <div class="box-9"><img src="images\weagle.png" class="max-1"></div>
      <br>
      <div class="minibox-1"><img src="images\weagle.png" class="max-2"></div>
    </div>
    <p><strong>This technique is used to make images <em>responsive</em>, so that when viewed on a smaller device they scale down appropriately</strong>. You should not use this technique to load huge images and then scale them down in the browser. Images should be appropriately sized to be no larger than they need to be for the largest size they are displayed in the design. Downloading overly large images will cause your site to slow, and can cost users more money if they are on a metered connection.

    <h2>Viewport units</h2>
    <p>The <strong>viewport</strong> is the visible area of your page in the browser you use to view a site. Like most things, it too has its own size. To size something relative to a user's viewport, use <kbd><strong>vw</strong></kbd> for viewport width, and <kbd><strong>vh</strong></kbd> for viewport height.</p>
    <p><kbd><strong>1vh</strong></kbd> is equal to 1% of the viewport height, while <kbd><strong>1vw</strong></kbd> is equal to 1% of the viewport's width. You can use these units to size boxes as well as text. In the example below, we have a box which is sized as 20vh and 20vw. The box contains the letter "A," which has a <kbd>font-size</kbd> of 10vh.</p>
    <div class="box-10">
      A
    </div>
    <p><strong>If you change the <kbd>vh</kbd> and <kbd>vw</kbd> values, this will change the size of the box or font; <text style="text-decoration: underline">changing the viewport size will also change their sizes because they are sized relative to the viewport</text>.</strong> To see the example change when you change the viewport size, you will need to load the example in a new browser window that you can resize (as the embedded <kbd>&lt;iframe&gt;</kbd> that contains the example shown is above its viewport). <a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/sizing/vw-vh.html">Open the example</a>, resize the browser window, and observe what happens to the size of the box and text.</p>
    <p><strong>Sizing things according to the viewport can be useful in your designs.</strong> For example, if you want a full-page hero section to show before the rest of your content, making that part of your page 100vh high will push the rest of the content below the viewport, meaning that it will only appear once the document is scrolled.</p>
